    "The WNBA is composed by two conferences, the Eastern and Western conference. During the season, 12 teams (6 from the western and 6 from the eastern conference) play with each other, and try to win as many games as possible. Then is created a new classification, that gatters all 12 teams, and the best 8 teams (4 from the western and 4 from the eastern conference), qualify for the playoffs."
